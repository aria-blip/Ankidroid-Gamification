# Ankidroid-Gamification
this is the code used to make the process of ankidroid learning more fun this was crated epecially for the Japanese core 2.3 deck but can be used for any other decks

what deos it do?
when you get 3 answers right after each othere the background of teh card deck changes plus it plays a random selection of audio files 

notice :
if you use another deck you have to change the parameters to the decks so in my case i got the word of teh card with <span id="word" style="">{{Word}}</span>
 but you may have another keyword
